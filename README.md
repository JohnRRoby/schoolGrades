# schoolGrades
A table of letter grades for New Mexico schools since 2013

Since New mexico doesn't see fit to make this data available in easy, machine-readable format, here it is. 
The csv has five columns: District, School, Grade, Year and Value. The last is one I added by recoding the letter grade into a numeral.
There are gaps in the Grade column and thus the Value column, incidated by "NA"
The usual caveat: This is state data, I had to do a lot to clean it even aside from the scraping, etc. Caveat emptor.

Original data source is here: http://aae.ped.state.nm.us/
