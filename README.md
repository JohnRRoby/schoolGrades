# schoolGrades
A table of letter grades for New Mexico schools since 2013

Since New Mexico doesn't see fit to make this data available in easy, machine-readable format, here it is. 
The csv has five columns: District, School, Grade, Year and Value. The last is one I added by recoding the letter grade into a numeral -- F = 1, D = 2, C = 3, etc.
There are gaps in the Grade column and thus the Value column, incidated by "NA." This is because there were gaps in the state's data.
The usual caveat: I had to do a lot to clean the data even aside from the scraping, etc. Caveat emptor.

You can view the data as an interactive table by clicking on the link, or you can download it by pasting this into your browser:

then right click in the browser and choose "save as."
